This is a LED board I put up in the portkey office that shows a scrolling ticker board style metrics of the live usage on portkey

we process around 18M requests a day(that is a 100,000 Requests Per Minute!)

I published the dashboard at [https://portkey.ai/rankings/daily](https://portkey.ai/rankings/daily) (this is server side rendered and refreshed hourly)
